Osbeck, is a species of small evergreen tree in the flowering plant family Rutaceae, native to South Asia, primarily North eastern India.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The tree&#39;s ellipsoidal yellow fruit is used for culinary and non-culinary purposes throughout the world, primarily for its juice, which has both culinary and cleaning uses.The pulp and rind (zest) are also used in cooking and baking. The juice of the lemon is about 5% to 6% citric acid, with a pH of around 2.2, giving it a sour taste. The distinctive sour taste of lemon juice makes it a key ingredient in drinks and foods such as lemonade and lemon meringue pie.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The origin of the lemon is unknown, though lemons are thought to have first grown in Assam (a region in northeast India), northern Burma or China. A genomic study of the lemon indicated it was a hybrid between bitter orange (sour orange) and citron.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lemons entered Europe near southern Italy no later than the second century AD, during the time of Ancient Rome. However, they were not widely cultivated. They were later introduced to Persia and then to Iraq and Egypt around 700 AD. The lemon was first recorded in literature in a 10th-century Arabic treatise on farming, and was also used as an ornamental plant in early Islamic gardens. It was distributed widely throughout the Arab world and the Mediterranean region between 1000 and 1150.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The first substantial cultivation of lemons in Europe began in Genoa in the middle of the 15th century. The lemon was later introduced to the Americas in 1493 when Christopher Columbus brought lemon seeds to Hispaniola on his voyages. Spanish conquest throughout the New World helped spread lemon seeds. It was mainly used as an ornamental plant and for medicine. In the 19th century, lemons were increasingly planted in Florida and California.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In 1747, James Lind&#39;s experiments on seamen suffering from scurvy involved adding lemon juice to their diets, though vitamin C was not yet known.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The origin of the word &quot;lemon&quot; may be Middle Eastern. The word draws from the Old French limon, then Italian limone, from the Arabic laym&#363;n or l&#299;m&#363;n, and from the Persian l&#299;m&#363;n, a generic term for citrus fruit, which is a cognate of Sanskrit (nimb&#363;, &ldquo;lime&rdquo;).</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Culinary uses</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lemon juice, rind, and peel are used in a wide variety of foods and drinks. The whole lemon is used to make marmalade, lemon curd and lemon liqueur. Lemon slices and lemon rind are used as a garnish for food and drinks. Lemon zest, the grated outer rind of the fruit, is used to add flavor to baked goods, puddings, rice, and other dishes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Juice</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lemon juice is used to make lemonade, soft drinks, and cocktails. It is used in marinades for fish, where its acid neutralizes amines in fish by converting them into nonvolatile ammonium salts, and meat, where the acid partially hydrolyzes tough collagen fibers, tenderizing the meat, but the low pH denatures the proteins, causing them to dry out when cooked. Lemon juice is frequently used in the United Kingdom to add to pancakes, especially on Shrove Tuesday.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lemon juice is also used as a short-term preservative on certain foods that tend to oxidize and turn brown after being sliced (enzymatic browning), such as apples, bananas, and avocados, where its acid denatures the enzymes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peel</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In Morocco, lemons are preserved in jars or barrels of salt. The salt penetrates the peel and rind, softening them, and curing them so that they last almost indefinitely. The preserved lemon is used in a wide variety of dishes. Preserved lemons can also be found in Sicilian, Italian, Greek, and French dishes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leaves</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The leaves of the lemon tree are used to make a tea and for preparing cooked meats and seafoods.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
